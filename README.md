# 👁️🖼️ Computer Vision Labs - PP Winter 2024/25

This repository contains a collection of weekly assignments completed as part of the **Computer Vision course** at **Poznan University of Technology** during the **winter semester of 2024/25**.

The course involved both theoretical and practical aspects of computer vision, including topics like image filtering, segmentation, inpainting, and object detection. Each lab focuses on a specific task, implemented primarily in Python using libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy.

## 💡 What’s Inside?

Each lab is available in two formats:
- **`.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook (editable, runnable)
- **`.html`** – Static version for quick preview

Here’s what each lab covers:

| Lab | Topic | Description |
|-----|----------------|--------|
| Lab 1 | 🚀 Introduction | NumPy and Game of Life. |
| Lab 2 | 🖼️ Image processing | Introduction to image processing, colour spaces, image arithmetics, geometric transfromations. |
| Lab 3 | 🔍 Convolution | Convolutional operations and graphic interpretations, use of convolution in image processing and in mathemathics. |
| Lab 4 | ☯ Morphology | Binary and grayscale morphology, morphological operations as a tool to segmentation. |
| Lab 5 | 🌐 Frequency domain | Frequency domain image, image analysis in frequency domain, high-pass and low-pass filtering. |
| Lab 6 | 🧠 Descriptors | Description of pixels based on known image processing methods, matching key points of multiple images. |
| Lab 7 | ✂️ Image segmentation | Thresholding, cluster analysis, detecting image features (e.g. edges), region growing. |
| Lab 8 | 🎥 Video | Film processing techniques. |
